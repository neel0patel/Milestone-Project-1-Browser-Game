# Milestone-Project-1-Browser-Game

Hello my names Neel and this is my first independent browser game project. This project's goal is to create a browser game with functionality, specs, and design that all work. The creation of this browser game consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This browser game will be a replica of the classic Fall Ball game.

To use the game yourself, you just need to open the HTML path in any browser and the game will run accordingly. Hit the start button and the game will proceed.

NOTE...every time you hit "start game" or the space bar after the games started, the game speed will increase!
