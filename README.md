# Milestone-Project-1-Browser-Game

Hello my names Neel and this is my first independent browser game project. This project's goal is to create a browser game with functionality, specs, and design that all work. The creation of this browser game consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This browser game will be a replica of the "Google chrome dino run" game.

To use the game yourself, you just need to open the HTML path in any browser and the game will run accordingly.
