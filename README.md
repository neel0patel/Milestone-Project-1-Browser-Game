# **Milestone-Project-1-Browser-Game**

### Description

Hello my names Neel and this is my first independent browser game project. This project's goal is to create a browser game with functionality, specs, and design that all work. The creation of this browser game consists of HTML, CSS and SCSS, and JavaScript. This browser game will be a replica of the classic Fall Ball game. Use the mouse to click `start the game`, afterwards, all that's needed is for you to use your `left` and `right` arrow keys to move the ball. This is what your screen will look like before starting the game.

### Development Setup

To use the game yourself, you to clone over the repo onto your own device and then copy and paste the path of `game.html` into your browser. Hit the start button and the game will proceed!

> _Note_ - You can increase the speed of the floors moving up by hitting `start game` button again!

### Issues

Every time you hit "start game" or the enter button after the games started, the game speed will increase! However, there's a minor occurrence at the end of the game where the pop up alert screen will pop up as many times as you hit the "start game" or enter button. Besides that the game runs smooth:smile:!
