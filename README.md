# **Milestone-Project-1-Browser-Game**

### Description

Hello my names Neel and this is my first independent browser game project. This project's goal is to create a browser game with functionality, specs, and design that all work. The creation of this browser game consists of HTML, CSS and SCSS, and JavaScript. This browser game will be a replica of the classic Fall Ball game.

To use the game yourself, you to clone over the repo onto your own device and then copy and paste the path of `game.html` into your browser. Hit the start button and the game will proceed!

### NOTE

Every time you hit "start game" or the enter button after the games started, the game speed will increase! However, there's a minor occurrence at the end of the game where the pop up alert screen will pop up as many times as you hit the "start game" or enter button.

Also, the ball tends to be buggy sometimes when dropping down in where it'll float down instead of smoothly dropping. I tried adjusting my ball drop code but really wasn't able to get that flowing how I wanted yet besides the two minor bugs, the game runs great so I hope you enjoy!
